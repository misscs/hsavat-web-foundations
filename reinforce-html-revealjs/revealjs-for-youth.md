## Adding a Slide

A slide is a container. Add your content in between the opening and closing `section` tag

```
<section>

</section>
```

---

### Give your slides a unique class

Give each of your slides a class to identify it. Use the class to style the
background of the slide.

---

#### Add solid background color

Add emphasis and make text and images pop

---

#### Add background images

Add an opaque box around content to add depth

---

### Use slide class to target css

```
h1 {
  // all h1 get these styles
}

.intro-slide h1 {
  // only the h1 on the intro slide will get these styles
}
```

---

### Tell one story per slide

Use header tags `h1` or `h2` tags to introduce the topic of your slide.

```
<section class="intro-slide">

<h1>Presentation about presentations</h1>

</section>
```

---

# Use images

Images tell a powerful story.


---

# Position your images in different places on the screen

---

### Change text color

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}

```
